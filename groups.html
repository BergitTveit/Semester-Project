          <h3>Kids</h3>
          <p>
            Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can
            learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not
            travel back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth?
          </p>
          <p>
            We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
            Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
            experiment with our team of experts. During the school holidays we
            run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age
            to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to
            explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you can
            join, send us a message

          <h3>For Teachers</h3>
          <p>
            As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
            places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
            students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
            laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite
            and inspire them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our
            facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through for
            a visit.
